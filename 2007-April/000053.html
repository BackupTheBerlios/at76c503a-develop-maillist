<PRE>Quoting Erik Hovland &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/at76c503a-develop">erik at hovland.org</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> If you could keep LED support, it would be helpful. We are carrying a
</I>&gt;<i> patch in our tree that uses LEDs. I will see what I can do about getting
</I>&gt;<i> an updated patch to this list for those LEDs.
</I>
OK, let's keep the LED code for now.  It was just a cleanup based on nm output. 
We have bigger issues.

But I'm sure we'll be asked about the LED code if the driver is submitted again
for the kernel.  Something needs to be done about it.

What's really strange is that the LED code only indicates whether the driver is
loaded.  It's completely separate from any hardware.  If the hardware is
disconnected, the LED is still registered.

We can just as well have a separate module with the LED code that would indicate
its own presence.  But that's a sign that the LED code is useless as it is now.
