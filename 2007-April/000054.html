</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you could keep LED support, it would be helpful. We are carrying a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patch in our tree that uses LEDs. I will see what I can do about getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an updated patch to this list for those LEDs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, let's keep the LED code for now.  It was just a cleanup based on nm output. 
</I>&gt;<i> We have bigger issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I'm sure we'll be asked about the LED code if the driver is submitted again
</I>&gt;<i> for the kernel.  Something needs to be done about it.
</I>I think Johannes suggested using a LED trigger, that's why I added the
code.

&gt;<i> What's really strange is that the LED code only indicates whether the driver is
</I>&gt;<i> loaded.  It's completely separate from any hardware.  If the hardware is
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected, the LED is still registered.
</I>The trigger is registered during module load time and unregistered on
module removal, it triggers the led (if bound to any via sysfs) on
package receive - looks o.k. to me.
Cheers,

&gt;<i> We can just as well have a separate module with the LED code that would indicate
</I>&gt;<i> its own presence.  But that's a sign that the LED code is useless as it is now.
