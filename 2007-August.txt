Subject: [at76c503a-develop] [ANNOUNCE] at76_usb 0.16 released
Message-ID: <1186035819.6967.30.camel@dv>

Hello!

Version 0.16 of the at76_usb driver has been released.

The most important changes in this version may not be visible to the
ordinary users.  The code have been cleaned up, so that the driver can
be submitted for the Linux kernel inclusion.

This driver compiles for Linux 2.6.20 and newer, but it's impossible to
guarantee that it will compile for the future kernels.  Only submitting
the driver to the kernel would ensure that the driver stays up to date
with the kernel API.

Please don't complain that older versions are not supported.  A driver
to be submitted to Linux may not have any backward compatibility code.
It's already good that a way was found to support several kernels
without modifying the sources.

Two major bugs have been fixed.  Reloading the driver without unplugging
the device could cause kernel panic in older versions of the driver.
Running scan while the driver was in process of association could cause
kernel panic as well.

The driver now respects the channel in monitor mode.  While it can
capture beacons from neighboring channels, it won't capture packets from
all channels indiscriminately, as it was before.  Unfortunately, only
beacons are captured in monitor mode.  This appears to be a limitation
of the chipset.

It's now possible to read back all private parameters using the iwpriv
command.

The common event loop has been split into individual functions, which
may improve responsiveness of the system.  However, more work is needed
in this area.


If you want to reply to this announcement, please pick one list to podt
to, don't cross-post!

Subject: [at76c503a-develop] Homepage
Message-ID: <1186108146.19586.20.camel@dv>

Hello!

I have found how to update the homepage at http://at76c503a.berlios.de/

All the files are accessible over scp at
shell.berlios.de:/home/groups/at76c503a/htdocs for all members of the
project.

I ran all files through "tidy", updated the download links and the
latest released version.  I also made all files use the same style as
the rest of berlios.de.

But the biggest problem is that most of the information is obsolete.
Even things that are still correct are often unnecessary, such as
specific description of the debug mechanism of the driver, or list of
bugs in version 0.11.

Some pages show traces of editing with a narrow field of view.  For
instance, support for Linux 2.6.x is listed under limitations.

Most importantly, if a driver needs so much user-level documentation,
there is a problem with the driver.  Users are not supposed to read the
documentation for all drivers in the system!

One possible solution would be to preserve the current site for history
and write a short new homepage, essentially based on README, but with
the download location, links to the mailing lists and so on.

If anybody can help with the updating the site, please let me know.
