<PRE>Hello!

I have found how to update the homepage at <A HREF="http://at76c503a.berlios.de/">http://at76c503a.berlios.de/</A>

All the files are accessible over scp at
shell.berlios.de:/home/groups/at76c503a/htdocs for all members of the
project.

I ran all files through &quot;tidy&quot;, updated the download links and the
latest released version.  I also made all files use the same style as
the rest of berlios.de.

But the biggest problem is that most of the information is obsolete.
Even things that are still correct are often unnecessary, such as
specific description of the debug mechanism of the driver, or list of
bugs in version 0.11.

Some pages show traces of editing with a narrow field of view.  For
instance, support for Linux 2.6.x is listed under limitations.

Most importantly, if a driver needs so much user-level documentation,
there is a problem with the driver.  Users are not supposed to read the
documentation for all drivers in the system!

One possible solution would be to preserve the current site for history
and write a short new homepage, essentially based on README, but with
the download location, links to the mailing lists and so on.

If anybody can help with the updating the site, please let me know.

Regards,
Pavel Roskin
