This was a really good advice, thank you. Having the old and new
stacks available in the same driver helped a lot with debugging.

Again good advice, much appreciated. StGIT is really handy, I will
start using it a lot more.

I have the mac80211 port somewhat working now. My current stgit
patches are available here which should follow your advice:

http://www.valot.fi/kalle/at76/mac80211-port/20071209/

Please note that this is early work, for example removal of the old
legacy interface is still not done. Scanning, associating and pinging
to an open mode AP works does work. PSM, WEP and monitor mode are not
implemented. But I would prefer to hear any comments people might have
so that I can fix them up early.

The first three patches add debugging code which I need for mac80211
development. In principle I could drop them, but it would prefer to
have them in the driver.

Pavel, what's your opinion about add-mac80211-support patch, is it too
large? It only adds lines, there are no line removals, so basically it
should be quite safe. If you want, I can split it up.

I'm planning to add rest of the features/cleanups as separate patches
to avoid large patches. As usual, I will be working slowly but
hopefully we have something ready by the end of this year.

That's great news!

I suggest that you use "stg export -np" to make the patches numbered  
and to add ".diff" at the end.

It would be great if you run scripts/checkpatch.pl from the Linux  
sources on it to catch come trivial style errors.

I had to replace "%d" with "%zd" on lines 5406 and 5461 because size_t  
is 64-bit on 64-systems and doesn't fit int.

I suggest that you keep the patches separate.  It's much easier to  
join them if required than to split a combined patch.

I have no problems with it at all.

Actually, it's surprisingly short at 15k!

That's great.  Please let me know if you want your patches to be  
published in my repository.

OK, I will do that next time.

I will do that also. Also I haven't run sparse at all yet. I will run 
these two with my second patch set.

Will fix, thanks.

Good idea. I will just clean up the current patches and will add any new 
features as a new patch.

Excellent. They make my life easier.

Well, mac80211 simply rocks. After the port is finished, I will collect 
some statistics just to prove how much mac80211 helps WLAN driver 
development.

I have to do some cleanup first, so it's better that you do not apply 
the patches to any tree yet.

I have now updated my patchset and it's available here:

http://www.valot.fi/kalle/at76/mac80211-port/20071227/

It's now much more complete than the earlier one, for example it removes 
the old stack and netdev altogether.

> It would be great if you run scripts/checkpatch.pl from the Linux  
> sources on it to catch come trivial style errors.

I have run both checkpatch and sparse, and all errors should be fixed now.

There are few compiler warnings:

at76_usb.c:884: warning: 'at76_set_associd' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:902: warning: 'at76_set_listen_interval' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:988: warning: 'at76_add_mac_address' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:1232: warning: 'at76_get_current_bssid' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:1259: warning: 'at76_get_current_channel' defined but not used

This is because I haven't yet implemented a debug interface for the 
driver, but I will do that next. Pavel, what's your opinion of having a 
debugfs interface? I think other wireless drivers use that already.

Thanks, fixed.

Most of the features are now implemented, but there is still something 
missing. Here's the TODO from the patchset:

  * TODO for the mac80211 port:
  * o adhoc support
  * o RTS/CTS support
  * o Power Save Mode support
  * o support for short/long preambles
  * o export variables through debugfs/sysfs

I haven't run stress tests of any sort and I'm sure there's plenty of 
bugs also. But my plan is first to implement all the features and then 
start hunting bugs.

But please distribute the patches as you see fit. I think we should 
start thinking about asking comments from linux-wireless list. And, 
after the missing features are implemented, try to get the driver 
included to 2.6.26. Earlier we do this the better. mac80211 is changing 
quite fast and it would be easier from development perspective to have 
the driver in mainline.
