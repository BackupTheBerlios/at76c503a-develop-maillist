Hi Pavel!

&gt;&gt;<i> I have the mac80211 port somewhat working now. My current stgit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patches are available here which should follow your advice:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.valot.fi/kalle/at76/mac80211-port/20071209/">http://www.valot.fi/kalle/at76/mac80211-port/20071209/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's great news!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest that you use &quot;stg export -np&quot; to make the patches numbered and 
</I>&gt;<i> to add &quot;.diff&quot; at the end.
</I>
OK, I will do that next time.


&gt;<i> It would be great if you run scripts/checkpatch.pl from the Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> sources on it to catch come trivial style errors.
</I>
I will do that also. Also I haven't run sparse at all yet. I will run 
these two with my second patch set.

&gt;<i> I had to replace &quot;%d&quot; with &quot;%zd&quot; on lines 5406 and 5461 because size_t 
</I>&gt;<i> is 64-bit on 64-systems and doesn't fit int.
</I>
Will fix, thanks.

&gt;&gt;<i> Please note that this is early work, for example removal of the old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legacy interface is still not done. Scanning, associating and pinging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to an open mode AP works does work. PSM, WEP and monitor mode are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented. But I would prefer to hear any comments people might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so that I can fix them up early.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest that you keep the patches separate.  It's much easier to join 
</I>&gt;<i> them if required than to split a combined patch.
</I>
Good idea. I will just clean up the current patches and will add any new 
features as a new patch.

&gt;&gt;<i> The first three patches add debugging code which I need for mac80211
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development. In principle I could drop them, but it would prefer to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have them in the driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no problems with it at all.
</I>
Excellent. They make my life easier.

&gt;&gt;<i> Pavel, what's your opinion about add-mac80211-support patch, is it too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large? It only adds lines, there are no line removals, so basically it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be quite safe. If you want, I can split it up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, it's surprisingly short at 15k!
</I>
Well, mac80211 simply rocks. After the port is finished, I will collect 
some statistics just to prove how much mac80211 helps WLAN driver 
development.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm planning to add rest of the features/cleanups as separate patches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to avoid large patches. As usual, I will be working slowly but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hopefully we have something ready by the end of this year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's great.  Please let me know if you want your patches to be 
</I>&gt;<i> published in my repository.
</I>
I have to do some cleanup first, so it's better that you do not apply 
the patches to any tree yet.
