<PRE>Hi Pavel!

I have now updated my patchset and it's available here:

<A HREF="http://www.valot.fi/kalle/at76/mac80211-port/20071227/">http://www.valot.fi/kalle/at76/mac80211-port/20071227/</A>

It's now much more complete than the earlier one, for example it removes 
the old stack and netdev altogether.

&gt;<i> It would be great if you run scripts/checkpatch.pl from the Linux  
</I>&gt;<i> sources on it to catch come trivial style errors.
</I>
I have run both checkpatch and sparse, and all errors should be fixed now.

There are few compiler warnings:

at76_usb.c:884: warning: 'at76_set_associd' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:902: warning: 'at76_set_listen_interval' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:988: warning: 'at76_add_mac_address' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:1232: warning: 'at76_get_current_bssid' defined but not used
at76_usb.c:1259: warning: 'at76_get_current_channel' defined but not used

This is because I haven't yet implemented a debug interface for the 
driver, but I will do that next. Pavel, what's your opinion of having a 
debugfs interface? I think other wireless drivers use that already.

&gt;<i> I had to replace &quot;%d&quot; with &quot;%zd&quot; on lines 5406 and 5461 because size_t  
</I>&gt;<i> is 64-bit on 64-systems and doesn't fit int.
</I>
Thanks, fixed.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm planning to add rest of the features/cleanups as separate patches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to avoid large patches. As usual, I will be working slowly but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hopefully we have something ready by the end of this year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's great.  Please let me know if you want your patches to be  
</I>&gt;<i> published in my repository.
</I>
Most of the features are now implemented, but there is still something 
missing. Here's the TODO from the patchset:

  * TODO for the mac80211 port:
  * o adhoc support
  * o RTS/CTS support
  * o Power Save Mode support
  * o support for short/long preambles
  * o export variables through debugfs/sysfs

I haven't run stress tests of any sort and I'm sure there's plenty of 
bugs also. But my plan is first to implement all the features and then 
start hunting bugs.

But please distribute the patches as you see fit. I think we should 
start thinking about asking comments from linux-wireless list. And, 
after the missing features are implemented, try to get the driver 
included to 2.6.26. Earlier we do this the better. mac80211 is changing 
quite fast and it would be easier from development perspective to have 
the driver in mainline.
