Subject: [at76c503a-develop] workqueue fixes for 2.6.20
Message-ID: <20070108221014.GA4573@bogon.ms20.nix>

Hi,
Here's the current head updated to compile and work with 2.6.20:
 git-clone http://honk.sigxcpu.org/git/at76c503a.git/
This branch also drops support for kernel versions < 2.6.20 in
preparation for submitting the driver into the wireless-dev tree.
Shall I merge this into a CVS branch called wireless-dev or something?
Cheers,
 -- Guido

That's very much appreciated!

I actually hoped to add support for the latest WPA enables firmware
first, but I didn't have a chance to look at that.

Perhaps it's a good idea to submit the driver to the kernel so that it's
kept up to date.  I did some preparation too but never submitted the
driver.

I'm not sure we actually want to drop support for older kernels right
now.   Maybe the portable version should be maintained in addition to
the version in the kernel.

I think now is too early to drop support for old kernels. You should place
all code that is needed for old kernels in #ifdef OLD_KERNEL ... #endif it
will be easy to delete this parts in the future.

Subject: [at76c503a-develop] Adding the at76_usb wireless driver
Message-ID: <20070110145724.GA4171@bogon.ms20.nix>

Hi John,
attached is a patch that adds the at76_usb wireless driver to
2.6.20-rc3. It supports the at76c503, at76c505 and at76c505a wireless
USB adapters.

Could you please comment on what needs to be adjusted to get the driver
included into your wireless linux git tree?

Please note that I'm not the author of the driver, the driver itself
lists these copyright holders (but none of them showed up on the
mailing list during the last couple of months):

Copyright (c) 2002 - 2003 Oliver Kurth
Copyright (c) 2004 Joerg Albert <joerg.albert at gmx.de>
Copyright (c) 2004 Nick Jones
Copyright (c) 2004 Balint Seeber <n0_5p4m_p13453 at hotmail.com>

Pavel Roskin, Maxim Grechkin and me were committing to CVS recently.

The projects homepage is:
    http://at76c503a.berlios.de/
I'm currently maintaining a (hopefully short lifed) git tree that
removes support for older kernels, older wireless extensions, C99 style
comments, commented out code and changes the workque interface for
2.6.20.  This is only done to ease reviewing - there are no functional
changes over the CVS archive:
    git-clone http://honk.sigxcpu.org/git/at76c503a.git/
The version in this repository is what's attached to this mail. The
driver was tested (and is in pracitical use) on at least i386 and
powerpc.
Cheers,
 -- Guido

Same here. But I think we can fix this up later.

Just did so. I think we'll have to fixup some things anyway before it
gets accepted, maybe we even have WPA working by then.

Agreed. All bugfixes shall go back into CVS head but we won't get the
driver accepted with the old cruft included, I guess.

Hello!

Guido, I think this should have been sent to the netdev list, not to
John's personal e-mail.  Anyway, the next iteration will be sent to the
list.

I think we should get rid of names at76c503 and at76c503a.  They are
misleading because they exclude at76c505 and at76c505a.  In fact, I
don't think there was even a chip called at76c503a.  And calling the
driver at76c50x would imply non-USB chips such as at76c504.  What really
matters is that it's a USB driver, so at76_usb seems appropriate,
although I tent to think that atmel_usb may be even better for
consistency.

I second this request.  At least please have a short look.  The next
iteration will go to the list.

x86_64 is also OK.  The driver has been checked by sparse and produces
no warnings even with all warnings enabled.

I agree.  It would only help if the driver sits next to the PCI/PCMCIA
Atmel driver that already used the WPA enabled firmware.

We probably should go through another round of renaming.  This time, I'd
like Simon Kelley to be involved.

No need to guess, it's a fact :)

That said, they are some non-intrusive ways of maintaining backward
compatibility, such as using -include in CFLAGS to include the
compatibility header.  This only works to a degree, but it's not like we
care about something really older than two or three revisions back (to
cover most current distros).

Message-ID: <20070110202616.GA10807@bogon.ms20.nix>

Hi,
when pluggin in my at76c503 the adapter sometimes (maybe 1 out of 10
cases) doesn't get detected properly. This is what happens:

/var/scratch/at76c503a/git/at76c503.c: opmode -32
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
Is this broken pipe in do_probe o.k.? I'm always seeing this.

I tried increasing the firmware download timeout but this doesn't seem
to help. Any ideas (arch is ppc)?

Hmm, I think the problem is that atmel_usb could easily become 
non-descriptive / ambiguous, as Atmel make a variety of USB chips, and 
are likely to make more in the future.  I'd propose something like:

1. atmel_wifi_usb

or

2. at76c50x_usb

FWIW, until recently I was using it (reasonably heavily, 24/7) on arm as 
well...
