<PRE>Hello!

Guido, I think this should have been sent to the netdev list, not to
John's personal e-mail.  Anyway, the next iteration will be sent to the
list.

I think we should get rid of names at76c503 and at76c503a.  They are
misleading because they exclude at76c505 and at76c505a.  In fact, I
don't think there was even a chip called at76c503a.  And calling the
driver at76c50x would imply non-USB chips such as at76c504.  What really
matters is that it's a USB driver, so at76_usb seems appropriate,
although I tent to think that atmel_usb may be even better for
consistency.

I second this request.  At least please have a short look.  The next
iteration will go to the list.

&gt;<i> The version in this repository is what's attached to this mail. The

</I>&gt;<i> powerpc.

x86_64 is also OK.  The driver has been checked by sparse and produces
no warnings even with all warnings enabled.
