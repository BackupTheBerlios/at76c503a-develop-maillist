I agree.  It would only help if the driver sits next to the PCI/PCMCIA
Atmel driver that already used the WPA enabled firmware.

We probably should go through another round of renaming.  This time, I'd
like Simon Kelley to be involved.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure we actually want to drop support for older kernels right

</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. All bugfixes shall go back into CVS head but we won't get the

</I>
No need to guess, it's a fact :)

That said, they are some non-intrusive ways of maintaining backward
compatibility, such as using -include in CFLAGS to include the
compatibility header.  This only works to a degree, but it's not like we
care about something really older than two or three revisions back (to
cover most current distros).
