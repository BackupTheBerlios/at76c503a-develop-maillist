</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hmm, I think the problem is that atmel_usb could easily become 
non-descriptive / ambiguous, as Atmel make a variety of USB chips, and 
are likely to make more in the future.  I'd propose something like:

1. atmel_wifi_usb

or

2. at76c50x_usb

&gt;<i> The driver was tested (and is in pracitical use) on at least i386 and
</I>&gt;<i> powerpc.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>FWIW, until recently I was using it (reasonably heavily, 24/7) on arm as 
well...


Cheers,

Tim.
