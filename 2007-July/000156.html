<PRE>Change the interface name.  It's ethX now, not wlanX.  Update iwpriv
names.  Remove the section about module parameters, since they are gone
(except &quot;debug&quot;, but it's also on the way out).  iwconfig requires
&quot;power&quot; twice on the command line to enable power management and set
listen interval at once.

-Module Parameters
------------------
-
-You can use &quot;modinfo at76_usb&quot; to see the complete list of the supported
-parameters with descriptions.  Use module parameters on the &quot;modprobe&quot;
-command line.  If the &quot;at76_usb&quot; module is loaded already, unload it
-first with &quot;modprobe -r at76_usb&quot;.
-
-Once you know which parameters you need, use the &quot;options&quot; command in
-/etc/modprobe.conf to use them every time the module is loaded.
-
-For example, you can give the network device another name than wlanX by
-giving the module the &quot;netdev_name&quot; parameter:
-
-  modprobe at76_usb netdev_name=eth%d
-
-If this parameter is used, the first device would be eth0 (unless it's
-already used by another driver, of course), the second eth1 and so on.

 Private Parameters

 additional driver-specific parameters available via &quot;iwpriv&quot;.  Running
