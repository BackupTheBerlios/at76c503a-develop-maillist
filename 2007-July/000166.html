<PRE>Hello!

I have done everything that was in my TODO list for the kernel
submission.  Provided that my latest patches are OK, we should try to
submit the driver to the kernel.

The driver is not ideal, far from it.  But we need more eyeballs looking
at it to find what else should be fixed.  I fixed things that were easy
for me to find and to fix.  There are also things that are easy for
others to fix.

I think the biggest problem with the driver is that it essentially
implements it's own wireless MAC layer.  I'm sure it will be suggested
that we switch to mac80211.  The problem it, it's a lot of work, and
it's not guaranteed to succeed.  Essentially, at76_usb would cease being
a network driver, since its interaction with the network will happen
only through mac80211.

I tried several times to convert the driver, but I would find some other
issue every time and postpone the mac80211 conversion until that issue
is resolved.

One mystery is the code in at76_ieee80211_to_eth() that checks for an
&quot;ethernet frame is encapsulated within the data portion&quot; whereas the
ethernet header immediately follows the 802.11 header.  That condition
is never true for me.  The checks for source and destination addresses
matching the 802.11 header suggest that it's not some non-standard
header for bridging.  Rather, it's possible that some cards do
decapsulation in hardware.  My MA101 doesn't do it, and I'm not
enthusiastic about buying all possible supported cards to find out.  But
I don't want to keep support for a hypothetical feature during the
mac80211 conversion.

My estimate is that approximately half of the code will have to be
removed or rewritten during the mac80211 conversion.  So if there are
any issues with the current MAC code, I don't want to spend much of my
time on things that are on the way out.  On the other hand, the mac80211
conversion may turn out to be impossible, and then we'll need to fix our
implementation.

I think we should go ahead and submit the driver as is.  Then somebody
will tell us if mac80211 conversion is possible.

Maybe I should be the one doing the submission this time.  I spent quite
a lot of time looking at the code after all.  Guido, what do you think?

Also, Linux 2.6.22 has been released, and no released version of the
driver supports it.  I think I'll do a standalone release within days if
nobody objects.

I've updated the CVS repository with the files from git plus the patches
I've just sent.  If any of my patches are rejected, I'll revert them in
CVS.  The goal is to make it possible for others to test the changes now
without having to apply the patches.  Testers are welcome.
