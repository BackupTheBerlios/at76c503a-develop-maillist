</I>You went ahead already - that's perfect since you did all of the
relevant changes since the last submission attempt! I'd really like to
see the driver included into 2.6.23 but I think it's already been
rejected. Too bad since it'll be much harder to get broader testing with
it then. The least I can do is to update the debian package during the
next couple of days to 0.16.
Cheers,
