Unfortunately, there is a serious bug in the driver.  Initiating
scanning during association can cause kernel panic.   It's very easy to
reproduce by running &quot;iwlist scan&quot; several times in a row.

at76_iw_handler_set_scan() stops dwork_mgmt, but that's not enough.  It
appears that work_join needs to be stopped as well, and then the driver
still can panic.

It's quite possible that unloading the driver at the wrong time can
cause kernel panic as well.  Some works are never stopped, for instance
work_assoc_done.

I'm not going to rewrite the whole state machine, but something simple
and effective needs to be done.

I've committed some changes, that include adding debug for istate
transitions.  That may be helpful for debugging the problem.
