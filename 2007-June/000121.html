<PRE>Hello!

I could finally get the driver reindented.  This is important not just
because the code looks better, but also because all further changes can
be run through Lindent without having to format them manually.  Some
debug statements look bad, but they looked bad before, and they should
eventually be removed, as the code gets more stable and documented.

I removed all module parameters that can be set with iwpriv.  I can
imagine that wireless developers will try to get us remove even more,
but it's an important step.

I wanted to integrate workqueues and times, but I'm not sure it's really
worth the trouble.  There is no such thing as &quot;wait and reschedule&quot;.
But there is such thing as taking control over scheduling.  This is more
work that I thought.  The workqueues are used for 802.11 MAC
implementation, so they will be discarded if the driver is ported to
mac80211.  I may still try it, but it depends.

All that means that the the driver should be ready for another
submission attempt once my patches are applied.

I have enabled the compat.h mechanism I used in other drivers, which
allows pristine driver sources to be compiled for older kernels.  I
could backport the driver as far back as Linux 2.6.18.  Going further
back is trickier.

Considering that backward compatibility turned out to be an easier goal,
we may want to make another public release.  I suggest calling it 0.20,
since it's a major upgrade, at least in terms of stability.  This would
allow us to have the code tested.

Pavel Roskin
