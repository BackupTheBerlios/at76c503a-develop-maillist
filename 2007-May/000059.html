<PRE>Hello!

I've just fixed a very bad bug in the driver.  Basically, it would cause
kernel oops if the at76_usb module is loaded and unloaded twice.

What happens is that the firmware doesn't need to be downloaded on the
second module load.  Thus, the device registration is not rescheduled,
but called immediately.  The problem is, it happens before
SET_NETDEV_DEV, which confuses the network layer and ultimately crashes
the kernel on device unregistration.

I've been aware of that bug for a long time, and I feel much better
about submitting the driver now that the bug is fixed.

It looks like that the firmware download was rescheduled to avoid that
bug.  Perhaps it doesn't need to be rescheduled anymore.  That's
something we could try.

My other serious concern is that the monitor mode is implemented on top
of scan.  That's quite weird.  As a result, the device switches between
different channels in the monitor mode instead of staying on the user
selected channel.  At very least, the monitor mode should stay on the
same channel.  Ideally, it should be completely separate from scanning.

We also need to integrate timers into workqueues.  It makes no sense to
reschedule events twice.  That should be easy.

On the more cosmetic side, I'd like to rename &quot;dev&quot; to &quot;priv&quot; whenever
it's used for the private data.  That's the standard convention in the
network devices.  In fact, &quot;dev&quot; is often used for the network device.
The driver is quite inconsistent now.  It uses &quot;dev&quot; and &quot;priv&quot; for
private data, whereas the network device uses &quot;netdev&quot; and sometimes
&quot;dev&quot;.

Also, it would be nice to integrate at76_do_probe() into at76_probe().
This split is quite illogical.  It splits similar code between two
functions.  In fact, &quot;interface&quot; is not passed to at76_do_probe() and
has to be calculated.  The resulting function could be split in a more
reasonable way.

I think I'll send some patches as RFC (request for comments) or RFT
(request for testing).

I tried to find the suggestions by Johannes, but I'm afraid I'm missing
some of his later e-mails.  Of the suggestions I could find, only two
seem still relevant:

Re-indent the code.  I don't think we can do it wholesale, as it would
damage some intentional formatting.  Bet there are still occurrences of
very long lines and missing spaces around operators.  While at that, we
should probably remove some debugging code.  I, for one, never trust
debugging code written by others.

Convert semaphores to mutexes.  That should be easy, as we only have one
semaphore.  Semaphores are clearly a thing of the past.  All new
wireless drivers are using mutexes.

Guido, could you please check if I missed anything of Johannes'
suggestions?
