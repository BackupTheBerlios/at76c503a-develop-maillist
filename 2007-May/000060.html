<PRE>Hi Pavel.

</I>Great!

[..snip..]
&gt;<i> My other serious concern is that the monitor mode is implemented on top
</I>&gt;<i> of scan.  That's quite weird.  As a result, the device switches between
</I>&gt;<i> different channels in the monitor mode instead of staying on the user
</I>&gt;<i> selected channel.  At very least, the monitor mode should stay on the
</I>&gt;<i> same channel.  Ideally, it should be completely separate from scanning.
</I>That would be nice but can maybe be fixed up later.

&gt;<i> We also need to integrate timers into workqueues.  It makes no sense to
</I>&gt;<i> reschedule events twice.  That should be easy.
</I>Agreed.

&gt;<i> On the more cosmetic side, I'd like to rename &quot;dev&quot; to &quot;priv&quot; whenever
</I>&gt;<i> it's used for the private data.  That's the standard convention in the
</I>&gt;<i> network devices.  In fact, &quot;dev&quot; is often used for the network device.
</I>&gt;<i> The driver is quite inconsistent now.  It uses &quot;dev&quot; and &quot;priv&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> private data, whereas the network device uses &quot;netdev&quot; and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dev&quot;.
</I>Yes, the current naming is very inconsistent and hurts the eye. I used
priv for everything new but the old stuff should be renamed too, at
least step by step.

&gt;<i> Also, it would be nice to integrate at76_do_probe() into at76_probe().
</I>&gt;<i> This split is quite illogical.  It splits similar code between two
</I>Agreed.

&gt;<i> I tried to find the suggestions by Johannes, but I'm afraid I'm missing
</I>&gt;<i> some of his later e-mails.  Of the suggestions I could find, only two
</I>&gt;<i> seem still relevant:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Re-indent the code.  I don't think we can do it wholesale, as it would
</I>&gt;<i> damage some intentional formatting.  Bet there are still occurrences of
</I>&gt;<i> very long lines and missing spaces around operators.  While at that, we
</I>&gt;<i> should probably remove some debugging code.  I, for one, never trust
</I>&gt;<i> debugging code written by others.
</I>I reindentet much of the code using lindent a while ago, there shouldn't
be too many bad spots left but those remaining should indeed be cleaned
up. I wouldn't be sad to see the debugging code go, we can always keep
it on a separate branch if we want the code to stay around.

&gt;<i> Convert semaphores to mutexes.  That should be easy, as we only have one
</I>&gt;<i> semaphore.  Semaphores are clearly a thing of the past.  All new
</I>&gt;<i> wireless drivers are using mutexes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Guido, could you please check if I missed anything of Johannes'
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions?
</I>- reorder code for less function prototypes
- remove module parameters that can be set by iwpriv
- pass struct at76_priv to at76_get_fw_info and fill that in instead of
  using that many parameters
and
- move static u8 snapsig/rfc1042sig/hw_rates/channel_frequency out of
  the header file
which I just fixed.

I think that's about it.
Cheers,
 -- Guido
