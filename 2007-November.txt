Hello, Kalle!

I'm glad you are back.

My point was that all those rebases were not as safe as they should have
been.

Actually, I didn't update that branch, so it's behind the development.
It would be great is you base your patches on the "master" branch.  It
has exactly the same code as the kernel plus the patch that converts the
driver to net/mac80211.h header.

You could use mac80211-kalle for reference and for debugging.  Actually,
it doesn't compile against wireless-2.6/everything due to API changes.
open() should be renamed to start() and stop() returns void now.  If I
change that, I get a crash in at76_probe().  I cannot debug it further
at the moment.

So, the first step would be to fix compatibility.

That's something you can try.

But I think one way to approach the problem would be to add the mac80211
based device without removing the network device.  This way, you have
the old and the new code side-by side, there are no warnings about
unused functions.

You could make the new implementation call the old one temporarily.  You
could insert debug statements and see if the new and the old interface
do the same thing to the hardware.

Please make sure that CMD_JOIN is issued at the right time, as I
suggested before.

Things have changed.  The kernel is up-to-date with the master branch
(except the header conversion), but your code is out-of-date.

I don't think you'll be able to split the patch after the fact.  It
would be easier to make separate changes.  With StGIT, you can always
return to the old patches to adjust them as necessary.

The first patch would be to add device registration.  Then the rx and tx
functions (you could make the rx function deliver packets to whichever
interface is up).  Then whatever else is needed for mac80211 support.
Then removal of netdev and the trivial cleanups.  Then deeper cleanups.

  I'm too:) If you would need any help with testing/debugging, I can
help at least a bit. I would like to help as much as possible to speed
up mac80211 conversion. After that, I could start implementing support
for 1.103.x firmware.
