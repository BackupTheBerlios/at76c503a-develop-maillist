<PRE>Hello, Kalle!

I'm glad you are back.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see that your patch removes printing MAC address on startup.  Look for

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I'll fix that.
</I>
My point was that all those rebases were not as safe as they should have
been.

&gt;<i> &gt; So I moved your changes to a separate branch &quot;mac80211-kalle&quot; and reset
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;master&quot; branch to what it was before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good. I base my work on mac80211-kalle branch from now on.
</I>
Actually, I didn't update that branch, so it's behind the development.
It would be great is you base your patches on the &quot;master&quot; branch.  It
has exactly the same code as the kernel plus the patch that converts the
driver to net/mac80211.h header.

You could use mac80211-kalle for reference and for debugging.  Actually,
it doesn't compile against wireless-2.6/everything due to API changes.
open() should be renamed to start() and stop() returns void now.  If I
change that, I get a crash in at76_probe().  I cannot debug it further
at the moment.

So, the first step would be to fix compatibility.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think the next step should be the conversion without any cleanup (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even fine with compiler warnings about unused functions), and then all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cleanup should be done as separate commits.  Any changes to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugging code should be separate too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I was thinking of first looking at what's wrong with the
</I>&gt;<i> frame transmission with my patch. After I have solved that one then I
</I>&gt;<i> will start the patch refactoring. I hope this okay with you.
</I>
That's something you can try.

But I think one way to approach the problem would be to add the mac80211
based device without removing the network device.  This way, you have
the old and the new code side-by side, there are no warnings about
unused functions.

You could make the new implementation call the old one temporarily.  You
could insert debug statements and see if the new and the old interface
do the same thing to the hardware.

&gt;<i> &gt; I do appreciate your efforts, as they show that the mac80211 conversion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is possible, but I cannot just take the code as is and massage it into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I'm not yet convinces that the mac80211 port is possible. I
</I>&gt;<i> want to see transmission side working first.
</I>
Please make sure that CMD_JOIN is issued at the right time, as I
suggested before.

&gt;<i> &gt; My patches that bring the driver in the at76 branch of the kernel more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up-to-date with my repository haven't been applied yet, so the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version of the driver is not suitable for development yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good to know. I will first debug the transmission problem with
</I>&gt;<i> mac80211-kalle branch and after that is solved, I will start cutting
</I>&gt;<i> the patch to smaller pieces.
</I>
Things have changed.  The kernel is up-to-date with the master branch
(except the header conversion), but your code is out-of-date.

I don't think you'll be able to split the patch after the fact.  It
would be easier to make separate changes.  With StGIT, you can always
return to the old patches to adjust them as necessary.

The first patch would be to add device registration.  Then the rx and tx
functions (you could make the rx function deliver packets to whichever
interface is up).  Then whatever else is needed for mac80211 support.
Then removal of netdev and the trivial cleanups.  Then deeper cleanups.
