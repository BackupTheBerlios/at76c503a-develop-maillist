Any specific reason for this?

1) We should not change it arbitrarily.  One user has complained about
breakage, and it took me and him some time to figure it out.

2) That's the name the driver would use once converted to mac80211.

3) It's not an ethernet device.  Only old wireless drivers use "eth"
names (e.g. orinoco), mostly due to the tradition.

That's a good point.

I changed the name since wireless drivers were _supposed_ to be called
ethX (although not ethernet at all) to actually get a chance to be
included in the kernel. There were several threads on LKML discussing
this - glad this changed now. Thanks for the clarification.

Subject: [at76c503a-develop] Implementing support for WPA-enabled firmware
Message-ID: <1193154049.24189.32.camel@localhost>

  Hello

  I would like to start implementing support for firmwares of version
1.x (which should also support WPA). Is there any official documentation
to interface of this firmware? From what I have been trying to get from
Atmel, the only result I got is that "this hardware is not supported
anymore". So, the only way so far is to document Atmel's own
atmelwlandriver and  implement these changes to at76c503 driver.

  Err, and to not forgot -- is such effort desired? I mean, would
support for WPA firmware help, if mac80211 conversion succeeds? I can
imagine that WPA enc/dec would be handled in chip itself by firmware, so
from this point of view probably yes, at least for ipaqs with builtin
at76c503a wifi.

	Milan

Let's call the firmware 1.103 for clarity, since 1.x would cover e.g.
1.101, which doesn't support WPA.

That's correct.  The Atmel's driver is still available on CVS:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous at atmelwlandriver.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/atmelwlandriver co atmelwlandriver

In particular, "struct mib_mac_wep" has to be changed (see
MAC_ENCRYPTION_MIB in src/includes/usb/mib.h in the Atmel sources).

Some reserved fields are no longer reserved in the Tx buffer.  Look for
CipherType in the Atmel sources.

Also, 1.103 firmware doesn't provide the FCS in the received packets.

Yes, slow embedded devices will benefit most.

Supporting WPA and non-WPA firmware would be tricky, so I guess Intersil
radio support will have to be dropped.  There is no WPA capable firmware
for those devices, and they are so obsolete, that I could not find any
on eBay, unlike the newer designs.

I think it would be great to switch to WPA-capable firmware, but only
after switching to mac80211.
