Let's call the firmware 1.103 for clarity, since 1.x would cover e.g.
1.101, which doesn't support WPA.

&gt;<i>  From what I have been trying to get from

</I>&gt;<i> atmelwlandriver and  implement these changes to at76c503 driver.
</I>
That's correct.  The Atmel's driver is still available on CVS:

cvs -d :pserver:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/at76c503a-develop">anonymous at atmelwlandriver.cvs.sourceforge.net</A>:/cvsroot/atmelwlandriver co atmelwlandriver

In particular, &quot;struct mib_mac_wep&quot; has to be changed (see
MAC_ENCRYPTION_MIB in src/includes/usb/mib.h in the Atmel sources).

Some reserved fields are no longer reserved in the Tx buffer.  Look for
CipherType in the Atmel sources.

Also, 1.103 firmware doesn't provide the FCS in the received packets.

&gt;<i>   Err, and to not forgot -- is such effort desired? I mean, would
</I>&gt;<i> support for WPA firmware help, if mac80211 conversion succeeds? I can
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that WPA enc/dec would be handled in chip itself by firmware, so
</I>&gt;<i> from this point of view probably yes, at least for ipaqs with builtin
</I>&gt;<i> at76c503a wifi.
</I>
Yes, slow embedded devices will benefit most.

Supporting WPA and non-WPA firmware would be tricky, so I guess Intersil
radio support will have to be dropped.  There is no WPA capable firmware
for those devices, and they are so obsolete, that I could not find any
on eBay, unlike the newer designs.

I think it would be great to switch to WPA-capable firmware, but only
after switching to mac80211.
