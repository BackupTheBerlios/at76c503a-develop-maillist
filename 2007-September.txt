Subject: [at76c503a-develop] mac80211 conversion of at76_usb
Message-ID: <1188617553.9555.29.camel@dv>

Hello!

We need some coordinated plan for further development of at76_usb.

My git repository is located at http://git.80211libre.org/at76_usb.git
It cannot be cloned by cg-clone, but it can be cloned by git-clone and
used with Cogito (although I would recommend StGIT or plain git
instead).

I intend to get rid of any private repositories and to move the
development to the kernel git repository.  But it needs to be done in
such way that the current mac80211 conversion efforts are not lost.

The files in the wireless-dev/at76 branch are not current.  I don't know
how they got into the kernel, but it's revision called "Fixes suggested
by checkpatch.pl" from June 24.  I have tagged it as
"initial_kernel_git_appearance" in my repository.

It's 57 revisions away from the tip, which is version 0.16.  There are
no major changes, but some patches are quite intrusive, such as the one
that eliminates all uses of err().

Kalle started his work on a commit somewhere between
"initial_kernel_git_appearance" and the tip.  I have tagged that point
as "kalle_start".  Then Kalle rebased his changes to the revision in the
kernel, which is older.

It's very unfortunate, and I'm sorry that I could not prevent that
useless effort.  I hope no significant changes have been done after the
rebase.

I suggest following plan:

1) I prepare and submit patches that bring the kernel version to
"kalle_start".

2) Kalle reverts the rebase and re-applies the changes made after the
rebase.

3) Kalle's changes go to a separate branch in my repository.

4) I rebase Kalle's changes on top of the HEAD.

5) Patches leading to 0.16 are submitted to the kernel.

5) The remaining issues with mac80211 are fixed.

6) The mac80211 patches are submitted to the kernel.

It would be great.  Hopefully, there will be few problems.  If I  
remember correctly, there is one moderately important fix (correct  
turning off the radio) and one large intrusive change (getting rid of  
err()).  The rest is pretty minor.  Some of the changes are in the  
code removed during conversion.

That's my goal too.  I just didn't want to force you to rebase your changes.

I understand the issue is with transmission.  It's probably some  
stupid error that will be found.  We'll need to make some minimal  
sanity checks, like sparse and testing on kernels with debugging  
enabled.  At this point, it should be fine to submit the changes to  
the kernel.

Yes, as long it's not required to involve all linux-wireless folks.

Thank you!  Please post the patch in any case.  Hopefully we'll fix

Just in case, please make sure you deal with APs with no encryption.   
Encryption can complicate things at this stage.  Please make sure that  
the system scripts don't set any WEP key.

That's a sign that transmission is working.  Please check is the  
firmware sends the probe requests by itself or they come from mac80211.

Just random ideas:

1) Wrong padding.  The firmware is very sensitive to it.  Try to  
increase padding.

2) Check if at76_tx_callback() is called.

3) Trace all calls to at76_set_card_command() to see which commands  
are sent to the firmware in the original and in the new driver.  Check  
the command results.

4) More specifically, check when CMD_JOIN is called in both drivers  
and whether is succeeds.  I think it's called much later, but check it  
anyway.

5) Try compiling with sparse:
make C=2 CF="-Wall -D__CHECK_ENDIAN__"

6) Check everything related to tx_urb.

7) Dump and compare Atmel Tx headers in both drivers.

I won't be able to check anything until Tuesday, but I'll try to help  
you with what I know.

Maybe URB status is not cleared after the first transmission or  
something like that.  Maybe something is not initialized anymore.

Good luck!

Hello again,

I downloaded the patch and looked at the code.  I don't see anything  
obviously wrong.  Sparse reports minor issues with integer conversion,  
but they cannot affect transmission.  I'm away from the hardware, so I  
cannot test any functionality.

I have committed the patch to the repository, just to make it easier  
for others to look at the code.  I don't think we need any branches,  
since the full focus of the development should be on mac80211  
conversion.

But the patch is applied temporarily.  I'm going to remove it from top  
and replace with something more reasonable.  Maybe I'll split some  
easy parts into separate patches.  Maybe I'll start a separate  
"cleaned-up" branch, which would eventually replace "master", and from  
which the patches for the kernel will be sent.  The final patches will  
be properly signed off and commented.

I would prefer not to have knowingly broken revisions in the code we  
are going to submit to the kernel.

Once again, to everybody - the converted driver is in my git  
repository.  Please get it and try to fix it.

I see that your patch removes printing MAC address on startup.  Look for
"%s: MAC address %s\n".  It's a minor issue, but it indicates that
something went wrong at some point.

I feel uneasy about applying such a massive patch that does so many
things at once, especially if there are signs that some code was lost in
the rebase process.

So I moved your changes to a separate branch "mac80211-kalle" and reset
the "master" branch to what it was before.

I also applied a patch that switches the driver from net/ieee80211.h to
net/mac80211.h.  Even though I had to bring some stuff from
net/ieee80211.h into at76_usb.h temporarily, it's worth the trouble.
This change that can be clearly separated from the rest of the changes.
The patch is short and it doesn't break anything for me.

I think the next step should be the conversion without any cleanup (I'm
even fine with compiler warnings about unused functions), and then all
cleanup should be done as separate commits.  Any changes to the
debugging code should be separate too.

I do appreciate your efforts, as they show that the mac80211 conversion
is possible, but I cannot just take the code as is and massage it into
something working.

My patches that bring the driver in the at76 branch of the kernel more
up-to-date with my repository haven't been applied yet, so the kernel
version of the driver is not suitable for development yet.

Thank you!  I've added this ID, as well as (0x07aa,0x0018) for mini2.

Hello!

Version 0.17 of the at76_usb driver has been released.

This is a stability release that includes only a handful of fixes.

- The default network device names will now start with "wlan", as in
  versions prior to 0.16.

- Fixed support for Belkin F5D6050.

- Added support for Corega Wireless LAN USB-11 mini and mini2.

- Improved messages in the kernel log.

- Packets captured in monitor mode use correct value for the protocol.

The driver is compatible with Linux 2.6.20 and newer, including the
forthcoming version 2.6.23.
