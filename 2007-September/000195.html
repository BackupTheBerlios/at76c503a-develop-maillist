<PRE>Hello!

We need some coordinated plan for further development of at76_usb.

My git repository is located at <A HREF="http://git.80211libre.org/at76_usb.git">http://git.80211libre.org/at76_usb.git</A>
It cannot be cloned by cg-clone, but it can be cloned by git-clone and
used with Cogito (although I would recommend StGIT or plain git
instead).

I intend to get rid of any private repositories and to move the
development to the kernel git repository.  But it needs to be done in
such way that the current mac80211 conversion efforts are not lost.

The files in the wireless-dev/at76 branch are not current.  I don't know
how they got into the kernel, but it's revision called &quot;Fixes suggested
by checkpatch.pl&quot; from June 24.  I have tagged it as
&quot;initial_kernel_git_appearance&quot; in my repository.

It's 57 revisions away from the tip, which is version 0.16.  There are
no major changes, but some patches are quite intrusive, such as the one
that eliminates all uses of err().

Kalle started his work on a commit somewhere between
&quot;initial_kernel_git_appearance&quot; and the tip.  I have tagged that point
as &quot;kalle_start&quot;.  Then Kalle rebased his changes to the revision in the
kernel, which is older.

It's very unfortunate, and I'm sorry that I could not prevent that
useless effort.  I hope no significant changes have been done after the
rebase.

I suggest following plan:

1) I prepare and submit patches that bring the kernel version to
&quot;kalle_start&quot;.

2) Kalle reverts the rebase and re-applies the changes made after the
rebase.

3) Kalle's changes go to a separate branch in my repository.

4) I rebase Kalle's changes on top of the HEAD.

5) Patches leading to 0.16 are submitted to the kernel.

5) The remaining issues with mac80211 are fixed.

6) The mac80211 patches are submitted to the kernel.

Pavel Roskin
