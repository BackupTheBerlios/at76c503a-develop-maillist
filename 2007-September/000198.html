<PRE>Hello, Kalle!

Quoting Kalle Valo &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/at76c503a-develop">Kalle.Valo at iki.fi</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> I have attached the patch. I must warn that it's far from finished.
</I>&gt;<i> There are lots of fixmes andc commented out code. I can clean it up
</I>&gt;<i> later, but now my focus is to get transmission working. Yes, I still
</I>&gt;<i> don't have transmission working :(
</I>
Just in case, please make sure you deal with APs with no encryption.   
Encryption can complicate things at this stage.  Please make sure that  
the system scripts don't set any WEP key.

&gt;<i> Receiving seems to work well, at least mac80211 can send scan results
</I>&gt;<i> to user space. I also managed to get the firmware send probe requests
</I>&gt;<i> and ack the probe responses from AP.
</I>
That's a sign that transmission is working.  Please check is the  
firmware sends the probe requests by itself or they come from mac80211.

&gt;<i> But authentication frames created
</I>&gt;<i> by mac80211 are not sent to the air and I don't know why. If anyone
</I>&gt;<i> has any hints why this might be happening, I would be really grateful.
</I>
Just random ideas:

1) Wrong padding.  The firmware is very sensitive to it.  Try to  
increase padding.

2) Check if at76_tx_callback() is called.

3) Trace all calls to at76_set_card_command() to see which commands  
are sent to the firmware in the original and in the new driver.  Check  
the command results.

4) More specifically, check when CMD_JOIN is called in both drivers  
and whether is succeeds.  I think it's called much later, but check it  
anyway.

5) Try compiling with sparse:
make C=2 CF=&quot;-Wall -D__CHECK_ENDIAN__&quot;

6) Check everything related to tx_urb.

7) Dump and compare Atmel Tx headers in both drivers.

I won't be able to check anything until Tuesday, but I'll try to help  
you with what I know.

&gt;<i> I ripped off code quite a lot and tried to simplify the driver. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> I removed some needed functionality?
</I>
Maybe URB status is not cleared after the first transmission or  
something like that.  Maybe something is not initialized anymore.

Good luck!
