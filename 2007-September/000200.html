I see that your patch removes printing MAC address on startup.  Look for
&quot;%s: MAC address %s\n&quot;.  It's a minor issue, but it indicates that
something went wrong at some point.

I feel uneasy about applying such a massive patch that does so many
things at once, especially if there are signs that some code was lost in
the rebase process.

So I moved your changes to a separate branch &quot;mac80211-kalle&quot; and reset
the &quot;master&quot; branch to what it was before.

I also applied a patch that switches the driver from net/ieee80211.h to
net/mac80211.h.  Even though I had to bring some stuff from
net/ieee80211.h into at76_usb.h temporarily, it's worth the trouble.
This change that can be clearly separated from the rest of the changes.
The patch is short and it doesn't break anything for me.

I think the next step should be the conversion without any cleanup (I'm
even fine with compiler warnings about unused functions), and then all
cleanup should be done as separate commits.  Any changes to the
debugging code should be separate too.

I do appreciate your efforts, as they show that the mac80211 conversion
is possible, but I cannot just take the code as is and massage it into
something working.

My patches that bring the driver in the at76 branch of the kernel more
up-to-date with my repository haven't been applied yet, so the kernel
version of the driver is not suitable for development yet.
