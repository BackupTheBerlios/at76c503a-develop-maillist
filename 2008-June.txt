I'm really busy with other things currently and I don't have time for
at76_usb, unfortunately. But it's great that you are working on,
at76_usb is in need for serious bugfixing.

If you don't hear anything from Pavel, I think you can just send the
fixes to linux-wireless list. I'm sure John will happily accept them,
because there has been complaints from Fedora users.
