</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Uhh, isn't there any possibility to create snapshot of only portion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the repository -- not only for developers, but also if any user would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to test GIT snapshot, it would be quite convenient to download just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's precisely the purpose of compat-wireless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the current driver is just not ready for prime time.  I tried it  
</I>&gt;<i> with WEP, and it was slow to associate
</I>
For me it associates as fast as iwl3945. mac80211 has serious problems
with associating (at least with iwl3945) and I'll consider that as a
mac80211 issue. Can you pinpoint if the problem you are seeing is
because of at76_usb or mac80211?

But I would like to get more information about your problem, if
possible. Especially monitor mode dump would be really helpful.

&gt;<i> and the ping turnaround was 2-4 seconds. It's like there is a sleep
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere, of the device is reset for every packet.
</I>
Yeah, I see this too. Sometime ping latency is normal 3-10 ms and
sometimes it can be high as 5 seconds. I'll try to fix this first.

&gt;<i> Also, the ad-hoc mode is missing.
</I>
Is that really so important feature that it would block inclusion to
the mainline? For me, Ad-Hoc mode is a low priority issue and I was
thinking to implement only after the stability issues are fixed.
