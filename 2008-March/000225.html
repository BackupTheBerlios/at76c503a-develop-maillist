<PRE>Quoting Kalle Valo &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/at76c503a-develop">Kalle.Valo at iki.fi</A>&gt;:

&gt;&gt;<i> But the current driver is just not ready for prime time.  I tried it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with WEP, and it was slow to associate
</I>
I'm sorry, I cannot keep specific setup for a long time.  I tried it  
today, and the association wasn't a problem, but slow transmission  
was.  I guess it should be addressed first since it's easy to reproduce.

That's Belkin F5D6050.  40-bit WEP is used.

&gt;<i> For me it associates as fast as iwl3945. mac80211 has serious problems
</I>&gt;<i> with associating (at least with iwl3945) and I'll consider that as a
</I>&gt;<i> mac80211 issue. Can you pinpoint if the problem you are seeing is
</I>&gt;<i> because of at76_usb or mac80211?
</I>
Yes, I know that iwl3945 can be slow, or more like it disassociates  
when dhclient is run and doesn't reassociate.  But the slow connection  
is only observed on at76_usb.

&gt;<i> But I would like to get more information about your problem, if
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Especially monitor mode dump would be really helpful.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> and the ping turnaround was 2-4 seconds. It's like there is a sleep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere, of the device is reset for every packet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I see this too. Sometime ping latency is normal 3-10 ms and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes it can be high as 5 seconds. I'll try to fix this first.
</I>
What I see is that most pings have turnaround close to a whole number  
of seconds, i.e. 1, 2, 3, even 10.  And the more you ping, the slower  
it gets, although it jumps back sometimes:

64 bytes from cvs (192.168.1.2): icmp_seq=18 ttl=64 time=10093 ms

64 bytes from cvs (192.168.1.2): icmp_seq=33 ttl=64 time=11092 ms

I tried to monitor it, and I see two issues.  One is that the AP sends  
the ping reply several times, usually from 2 to 4 times.  I guess it  
doesn't get the ACK.

Another problem is that when I start pinging a non-existent host, I  
see unrelated requests first, such as NTP requests, ARP for other  
hosts, and only then, after several seconds, an APR request for the  
host I'm pinging.  It's like some old packets are kept somewhere and  
need to be flushed.

It's a slightly unusual network because the AP MAC address is not  
equal the BSSID.  I'll try to set up a better testbed with a software  
based AP to see what is happening.

I just want to give you some information for now.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, the ad-hoc mode is missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that really so important feature that it would block inclusion to
</I>&gt;<i> the mainline? For me, Ad-Hoc mode is a low priority issue and I was
</I>&gt;<i> thinking to implement only after the stability issues are fixed.
</I>
I don't think it's a blocking issue.  I agree with your priorities.  I  
have no objection against the driver going to the mainline even in its  
present state.  In any case, it will take a lot of time for the driver  
to reach the users.

I just don't want a broken driver to be in the compat-wireless  
package, because we won't have a chance to fix it before it reaches  
the end users.  I don't expect users of compat-wireless to help with  
fixing the problem, and I don't want to disappoint them now and to get  
bug reports about things we know already.

Ad-hoc is optional.  Fixing slow connection is essential.
