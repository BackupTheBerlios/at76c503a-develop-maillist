  Ok:) This is what I wanted to know, I did not want to do changes in
the code whichis not directly related to new firmware, as I found out
that 0.90.x firmware doesn't seem to be able to associate with any AP I
have, so I have no way to test it.

</I>&gt;<i> I think you are trying to use the WPA enabled firmware (1.103), which

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  Yes, I was using this firmware. So I probably should check all
abovementioned conditions + presence of the WPA firmware before deciding
whether to report FCS or not (prepared patch actually does that). I have
just one issue to solve before I will submit at least something (it
looks like with current driver, first association attempt after loading
the driver doesn't work properly).
