I think we don't need to support more than one firmware at once.  I'm
absolutely fine with dropping Intersil radio support and going to 1.103
firmware across the board.  Cards with Intersil radio are simply
impossible to get anymore.  I've never heard of anyone with such card.
We should not use them as an excuse for not going forward.  That means
that we don't need to put any conditional.  We should simply reject the
firmware with the wrong version.

That said, I would prefer that we don't mix fixes and changes needed to
switch to the newer firmware.  But if the older firmware doesn't work
for you, then it's fine to do both.  I think I'll be able to split it
nicely.
