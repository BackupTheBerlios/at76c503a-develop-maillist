<PRE>  Hello,

  few days ago I finished another set of patches, which (at least for
me) enable support for 1.103 firmware -- both WEP and WPA/TKIP worked
nicely for me (I guess WPA2 worked as well, but I have no idea how to
find out whether wpa_supplicant used WPA or WPA2).

  Atmelwlandriver enabled support for AES/CCMP only for 505A and 505AMX
devices, so I have no idea how to test it, but it is implemented too.
I'm not sure whether key_rsc is handled properly, as I don't have exact
idea what does it do nor its effect on AES -- if anyone has such driver,
please test it and report whether it works.

  First of the patches contains only minor fixes I had to do in order to
make the driver work properly, it doesn't have any dependency on new
firmware. The other two patches implement support for WEP and WPA,
respectively.

   I also have one AP with which this adapter didn't work
(wpa_supplicant was not able to authenticate), but it's quite possible
it's fault of the AP. Other two APs I used to test it worked correctly.

  If there are any objections, please tell me, I will luckily change the
patches. And also -- is it enough to post them here, or I should also
send them to wireless-testing mailing list?

	Milan
